# GladiusEx - WotLK

The famous (and imo, far superior) arena frame AddOn GladiusEx - now for WotLK 3.3.5!

**The AddOn will not work on Classic WotLK, it will only work on the original WotLK client.**

## Installing

The folder "GladiusEx-WotLK-master must be renamed to "GladiusEx" and placed in /Interface/AddOns (relative the WoW root folder).

### Note

The "Incoming" Absorb/Heal portion of the healthbar module has been removed as the underlying API is non-existent in WotLK.

The "Cooldowns" module is only in beta mode. It should mostly work - but some abilities might be missing / have an incorrect CD / be missing some conditional (e.g., lower CD if some other talent that we know is picked). Feel free to report specific improvements that can be done, or create a pull request.
