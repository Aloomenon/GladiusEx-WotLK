# GladiusEx - WotLK

The famous (and imo, far superior) arena frame AddOn GladiusEx - now for WotLK 3.3.5!

**The AddOn will not work on Classic WotLK, it will only work on the original WotLK client.**

## Installing

The folder "GladiusEx-WotLK-master must be renamed to "GladiusEx" and placed in /Interface/AddOns (relative the WoW root folder).

### Note

The "Incoming" Absorb/Heal portion of the healthbar module has been removed as the underlying API is non-existent in WotLK.

The "Cooldowns" module is only in beta mode. It should mostly work - but some abilities might be missing / have an incorrect CD / be missing some conditional (e.g., lower CD if some other talent that we know is picked). Feel free to report specific improvements that can be done, or create a pull request.

### Disclaimer

The backport has not been widely tested and may contain serious bugs, if you choose to use the AddOn and find any such bugs please report them to me by creating an "issue" at https://github.com/ManneN1/GladiusExBackport-WotLK/issues/new.

What little testing has been done, was performed on "Virtus" Instant 80 PvP Realm.
